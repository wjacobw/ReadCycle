Readcycle is a peer-to-peer book exchange platform where readers can donate, borrow, and share books effortlessly. It connects book enthusiasts, allowing them to pass on knowledge through book exchanges, leave reviews, and earn points for contributing to the community. It also encourages donors to contribute more books by allowing them to earn both money and points. Donors are notified whenever someone borrows their books, and they earn additional points each time their books are borrowed within the ecosystem. These points can then be traded for rewards. Whether you're looking to donate your old books or find your next great read, Readcycle makes the process seamless and community-driven.
